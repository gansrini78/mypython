Git commands in bash  :

git init

git add <file name>

git status : show what is in local repo committed and not committed

git commit   : to save the file into local repository

git push  :  moves files frm local repository to remote repository like git hub


git pull: from remote to local repository

git clone : create a copy of the program or module in the remote repository into the local folder

git rm --cached <file name> to remove file from repo and move it back to staging

git commit -m  '<just mentioned what changes were made>'   : this commits the files without getting into edit window mode

clear  : this command is to clear bash screen

touch '<file name>'  creates a new file

.gitignore  :  this file keeps track list of files which we don;t want to commit . We just enter file names                   inside this file which we want to ignore

git branch <branch name>   : by default all files are in master branch. But we can create multiple 
			branches and create folders and files there .this is useful for multiple                                                 developers to work on the same file 

git checkout <branch name>  : it will take us into that branch
